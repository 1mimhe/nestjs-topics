RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using Observables.
It helps manage asynchronous data streams (like HTTP requests, events, WebSocket messages) in a declarative way.
 
Key Features:
- Event Handling (clicks, API calls, timers)
- Data Transformation (map, filter, merge)
- Asynchronous Operations (HTTP requests, WebSockets)
- Cancellation Support (unsubscribe from streams)

What is an Observable?
An Observable is a lazy data stream that can emit:
- Values (numbers, objects, events)
- Errors (if something fails)
- Completion signals (when the stream ends)
